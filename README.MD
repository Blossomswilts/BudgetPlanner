# Budget Planner

**Table of contents**

## Our Project
Our web application is a budget planner that helps you track your spending, set savings goals, and find a financial advisor. 
You can create a budget, set a savings amount, and track your progress over time. You can also set goals for yourself, such as saving for a down payment on a house or retirement. 
The application will help you track your progress towards your goals and make adjustments as needed. 
You can also insert receipt pictures and have the application pull the data you need. This is a great way to keep track of your spending and make sure you are on track to reach your financial goals.

## What our Project Solves
Our web application budget planner solves the problem of tracking and managing your finances. It can help you set budgets and track your spending. This can help you save money, pay off debt, and reach your financial goals.

Here are some of the benefits of using a web application budget planner:

* It's easy to use. You can create a budget in minutes, and then track your spending with just a few clicks.
* It's accurate. The budget planner will track all of your income and expenses, so you can be sure that you're on track with your financial goals.
* It's flexible. You can easily adjust your budget as your income and expenses change.

## Key Highlights of our Project / Usage
Within our project, the main feature is a graph found within the overview section. 
This graph updates accordingly whenever you set a budget, savings and also when you set your expenses. 
With out goals section, you are able to set some list goals that can serve as a guidance of what you are aiming for. 
If you have troubles with your own set goals, we have an API to help find a financial advisor near you.
With our receipts API, you are able to upload a picture of a receipt, and it will automatically instert that data needed in the expense section. 

## Problems Faced and Solutions
* At times, the chart will not render correctly when inputing an expense and/or goal. To fix this, clear local storage of last item or completely. 
* The OCR API was difficult to navigate and the documentation wasn't completely clear on how to use certain parts of it. To resolve this, multiple attempts were made to work around the errors, such as declaring the file type and giving the file a temporary URL. In the end, instructor support was needed to resolve the issue.

## Future Implementations
* User login: To keep tract of multiple accounts if needed, and access from multiple devices.
* Personalized features that would take the information from accounts, and implement them into different text areas, and more. 
* Monthly statements that iterates over past budget plans, to better keep tract of goals and past expenses. 
* Expense categories: So that you can see the percentage % of each type of expense, and better plan that way. 
* Colour customization for graphs.
* Set goals into its own page with extra customizations, and js implementations, such as full savings percentage, et cetera.
